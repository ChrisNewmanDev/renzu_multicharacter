# Feature
- Support ESX and QBCORE
- ESX Legacy Standard Multicharacter Logic using (char) as prefix
- Intro Cameras and BG music
- Character Deletion
- Support Showing Your custom Logo
- Builtin Character Registration
- Supports Spawn Selector (by default this uses my renzu_spawn as a Selector)
- Supports Latest skinchanger & fivemappearance or qb-clothing
- Supports /relog command (logout)
- Supports Updating Slots number via config or commands. there is no maximum number but 10-20 is good.

# Dependency
- ESX or QBCORE
- skinchanger or fivemappearance or qb-clothing
- xsound or renzu_mp3 (for bg intro) (OPTIONAL)
- renzu_spawn - for spawn selector (OPTIONAL)

# compatibilites
- this supports qb-spawn ( you need to disable spawnselector in config ) - by default qbcore is setup this way. so you can have your spawn in aparment, housing etc.. (temporary until i release my housing with apartments)
- esx_kashacters identifier logic - this dont support the old multicharacter logic. its only support if your esx legacy is using char as prefix for multicharacters
- Skins - this supports the skinchanger so this probably supports CUI characters too. since its a revamped skinchanger with creator ui.
